###### Laboratory work Nr. 1

I this laboratory work I built a small web application that acts as a quiz offering to the user a possibility to test his knowledge in terms of JavaScript. It has some well-known options like a timer indicating the remaining time for a question, the current question number, and some helper options that might give some hints to the user while answering the questions.

The project has been created using AngularJS, but the focus has been oriented on JavaScript mostly, as the main task of this laboratory work was to study and use the basics on JavaScript.
